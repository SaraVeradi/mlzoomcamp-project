## Introduction

This repository contains analysis on data about energy burnt during exercise in Calories. The data in ```exercise.csv``` shows different characteristics of the person during the exercise. It contains ``` 'age','body_temp', 'duration','gender','heart_rate','height', 'weight'```. Then it says if a person with these characteristics exercises, how much energy in Calories is burnt. The energy is stored in the file ```calories.csv``` and the two files are connected to eachother by an ```ID``` column. Although both files are ordered in the same way from top to bottom.
